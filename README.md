Patient Update Customer Relationship Management System

This is a Patient management application.

It was a quick build to see what kind of functionality would be needed for one of my previous employer. It is a working prototype of a customer relationship management(CRM). I allows for two different user privileges one as a basic user one as admin(more could be added later). 
The admin has the functionality to view all the locations for the trials, all the patient for those locations and if they drill down further all the information for any individual patient. All of the information for the patient could be modified and changed. An admin can create a new site location, create a new patient which would correspond to the specific site location. The admin also has privileges to add a new user to the system, since the system is not complete the next step would have been to add a third privilege level and allow only super admins to add new users. There is also a functionality to correspond a basic user with the site location, this way they are only able to see the relevant information to them.
The basic user has the privileges to see the study that they are responsible for. The the patients in their study and what is the status of those patient, this correspond to wether or not the user had contacted the patient or if the patient has replied to the user. Based on these criteria the status which is represented in colour is changed. The user has the ability to view more detailed information on the patients, but they are limited in the amount of things they are able to change.
There is also a print function implemented to be able to print the relative information.

For the admin you can use
username: admin     password: test

For the basic user you can use:
username: user     password: test

This is a very simple and far from complete system, but it has a strong base for additional features to be added. This was completed in about 3 weeks of part time work.
